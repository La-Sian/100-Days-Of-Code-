# 100-Days-Of-Code-
Set to take the #100daysofcode challenge, in which I'll commit to challenging myself to code everyday and share and document my progress of what of my journey over the next 100 days.

DAY 1:
I'm starting this challenge on day 1 of the SoC bootcamp kick off. Today we covered the importance of computational thinking and how we should use and refer back to it throughout the duration of the bootcamp but also in everyday tech. The process consisted of 5 areas: understanding the problem, breaking it down into smaller problems, looking for patterns, applying real life models as well as algorithms. We also covered css diner in pairs to revise CSS. I had a lot of nerves before today's session, however I'm feeling less anxious having met other bootcampers and having a more of a feel of what the SoC is about. Excited for what's to come!

DAY 2:

Today I went over computational thinking again, learning more terminology to solidify everything I’ve learnt so far, and had exercises where we could practise this. For example, I made a scratch game but had to plan every step beforehand to produce it, so I would have an algorithm to refer to in future. 
We also went over github to refresh what we previously learned such as making changes to files, as well as pulling and pushing from the local to remote repository and vice versa.

 Day 3:
 I jumped into Javascript fundamentals such as types, variables and functions. We practised using the console trial and error to see what did and didn’t work. I also incorporated using github and the terminal and coned files to edit some Javascript code. I did find JS functions not very clear so I will continue to work on that after todays bootcamp session.

 Day 4:
 Dived further into Javascript covering objects, loops, arrays completing tasks that let me practise the syntaxes. Objects were understandable in comparison to loops such as for and while loops, thus I have spent more time revising these by looking at  YT videos and other online resources. I also signed up to the 30 javascript challenge to improve my knowledge. 
 
 DAY 5

I was Introduced to the first hackathon to make a rock, paper and scissors game. This was a great way to bring together what I had been studying over the past week. 

DAY 6

Continued going over hackathon breaking down the challenges. I also researched more today on areas that I was more unfamiliar with such as functions and calling them as I am still learning the basics. I also learnt a new topic on a separate self paced course on Udemy such as arrow and anonymous functions 
Functions.

DAY 7

Went through what I have been learning over the last few days, variables, objects, functions, arrays and tried applying the Freyman technique to test my knowledge. I also applied to a course in javascript and if accepted will spend an extra 2 hours a week looking at javascript. 


Day 8 
My day consisted of learning a new topic, The DOM and how it can manipulate html in web pages. I looked at accessing, selecting, changing(appending and removing) html web pages with the DOM using Javascript .


Day 9

Looked at using AI efficiently to help perform tasks more efficiently using chatgpt and github co-pilot and put this into practice making a more improved version of the game rock, paper, scissors. Also, I looked over more of the DOM, in terms of event listeners making web pages more dynamic. 

Day 10
Today I looked at synchronous and asynchronous code and learning the difference between the two. I also learnt about the basics of fetch and API’s which I found it slightly challenging so I will do more research and see example to get a better understanding.

  Day 11
Today I went through more tasks on codewars to strengthen my debugging skills, applying what I have been learning over the past week and a half. 

DAY 12
I carried on with my 30 day javascript challenge and specifically looked over at functions and for loops as I  found I needed more revision to better my understanding as on codewars my skills and knowledge were tested.


DAY 13

I completed 3 tasks that were focusing on what I covered in week 2 such as fetch, APIs, query selector and for loops as well as arrays. I did find these tasks challenging but  I had tools such as chatgpt to help break down the problems.
