# 100-Days-Of-Code-
Set to take the #100daysofcode challenge, in which I'll commit to challenging myself to code everyday and share and document my progress of what of my journey over the next 100 days.

DAY 1:
I'm starting this challenge on day 1 of the SoC bootcamp kick off. Today we covered the importance of computational thinking and how we should use and refer back to it throughout the duration of the bootcamp but also in everyday tech. The process consisted of 5 areas: understanding the problem, breaking it down into smaller problems, looking for patterns, applying real life models as well as algorithms. We also covered css diner in pairs to revise CSS. I had a lot of nerves before today's session, however I'm feeling less anxious having met other bootcampers and having a more of a feel of what the SoC is about. Excited for what's to come!

DAY 2:

Today I went over computational thinking again, learning more terminology to solidify everything I’ve learnt so far, and had exercises where we could practise this. For example, I made a scratch game but had to plan every step beforehand to produce it, so I would have an algorithm to refer to in future. 
We also went over github to refresh what we previously learned such as making changes to files, as well as pulling and pushing from the local to remote repository and vice versa.

 Day 3:
 I jumped into Javascript fundamentals such as types, variables and functions. We practised using the console trial and error to see what did and didn’t work. I also incorporated using github and the terminal and coned files to edit some Javascript code. I did find JS functions not very clear so I will continue to work on that after todays bootcamp session.

 Day 4:
 Dived further into Javascript covering objects, loops, arrays completing tasks that let me practise the syntaxes. Objects were understandable in comparison to loops such as for and while loops, thus I have spent more time revising these by looking at  YT videos and other online resources. I also signed up to the 30 javascript challenge to improve my knowledge. 
 
 DAY 5

I was Introduced to the first hackathon to make a rock, paper and scissors game. This was a great way to bring together what I had been studying over the past week. 

DAY 6

Continued going over hackathon breaking down the challenges. I also researched more today on areas that I was more unfamiliar with such as functions and calling them as I am still learning the basics. I also learnt a new topic on a separate self paced course on Udemy such as arrow and anonymous functions 
Functions.

DAY 7

Went through what I have been learning over the last few days, variables, objects, functions, arrays and tried applying the Freyman technique to test my knowledge. I also applied to a course in javascript and if accepted will spend an extra 2 hours a week looking at javascript. 


Day 8 
My day consisted of learning a new topic, The DOM and how it can manipulate html in web pages. I looked at accessing, selecting, changing(appending and removing) html web pages with the DOM using Javascript .


Day 9

Looked at using AI efficiently to help perform tasks more efficiently using chatgpt and github co-pilot and put this into practice making a more improved version of the game rock, paper, scissors. Also, I looked over more of the DOM, in terms of event listeners making web pages more dynamic. 

Day 10
Today I looked at synchronous and asynchronous code and learning the difference between the two. I also learnt about the basics of fetch and API’s which I found it slightly challenging so I will do more research and see example to get a better understanding.

  Day 11
Today I went through more tasks on codewars to strengthen my debugging skills, applying what I have been learning over the past week and a half. 

DAY 12
Today was hackathon Friday were with the help of my team of 3, were able to make a dad joke generator game using the jokes from the dad jokes API and with the help of my group, add our own flare to create our version of the game. This consisted ranking the joke from awful, average and good once they have clicked generate joke button. 

DAY 13
I carried on with my 30 day javascript challenge and specifically looked over at functions and for loops as I  found I needed more revision to better my understanding as on codewars my skills and knowledge were tested.

DAY 14

I completed 3 tasks that were focusing on what I covered in week 2 such as fetch, APIs, query selector and for loops as well as arrays. I did find these tasks challenging but  I had tools such as chatgpt to help break down the problems. 


Day 15

Today was a look into frontend foundations. I was working on flexbox learning more on space distribution between items in an interface and powerful alignment capabilities.


Day 16

Today had a focus on front end foundations where I looked and researched about UX and UI in terms of what they are, importance and differences. This included basics such as visual hierarchy, scale, balance, and contrast. CSS was another topic covered leaning about specification 


Day 17

Continuing with the front end foundations, I completed a research task on forms finding out best practice guidelines for form designs and particularly looked at buttons, checkboxes, selectors, radio buttons, text input,file input and switch. 

Day 18

Today I tried cloning a version of a webpage from memory which did not get me very far. I then worked on a task to mimic an actual webapage such as Teslas and see if I could make my own edits and changes and to just play around with to see what and wouldn't work. 

Day 19
Hackathon friday. Created a landing page based on a parrot training program. Looked at websites to get an idea of the feel and look. Also researched different portfolios that would help create the webpage in terms of what users would want to achieve from this. This task was done using HTML and JavaScript.

Day 20 
worked on another task that is creating and designing a website about myself. Worked on planning in terms of what it was going to look like, the content being displayed such as homepage, projects, contact.

Day 21
I continued to work on week recap task were I started putting the plan to action starting on the HTML and CSS where I have completed the nav bar. 

DAY 22
Today was an introduction to software testing and looked at node.js Also completed a series of tasks that put this into practice, for example it covered esm, different commands of npm. 

Day 23
Today I was looking at more of an introduction to testing at a unit test level and focused on learning to approach testing in 3 steps: arrange, act, assert in other words what to prepare to call, calling function/thing your testing and to check expected to have happened

Day 24 

Started the day with codewars and worked on 4 problems and managed to complete. Later moved onto Testing but instead of isolated testing, expanded further onto end to end testing using playwright. 

DAY 25

Today started off with codewars and was able to complete 4 problems on level 8. The rest of the day wass spent on a hackathon based on end 2 end testing, where I tested a simple userface that inputs text, a date and slecects a button to list what was inputted. bc14_w4_hackathon_testathon-room-7-la-sian-danielle-mo 

DAY 26

Todays objective was to create my own kata on code wars that works by testing it using jest. I was able to create a kata, that conceptionally worked but did not yet get it to pass all tests.

DAY 27 & 28

Worked on more testing, focusing on end-to-end testing with playwright. I found this challenging as i came across multiple errors. 

DAY 29

Today consisited researching about React. I have no previous knowledge thus had to look up a large amounf of resources and found videos to be more useful. 

DAY 30

In more detail, covered more basic areas of React such as Virtual DOM, JSX and Props. I have a better understanding I why React is so popular but struggles with passing props. 


DAY 31

Dug slightly further into react looking at userState hook and lifting state. I found it particularly challenging, when having to import child states to the parent/root component. 

DAY 32

Today was looking at array methods- .map and .filter, as well as mutability and immutability and also keys and lists. 

DAY 33

Today was hackathon Friday. The goal was to make a to do list with react. We managed to create an input box and add to the list but never managed to have a working delete button.

DAY 34

Started on the recao tasks. Covering concepts I learnt of this past week. Exremely challenging.

DAY 35

Continued with the weekend recap task covering react making a blog website with a comment component, Comment list component. I found this task very difficult, not just the challenge but also with some of the terminology itself. 

DAY 36

Topic of the day was useEffect hooks. Went over briefly what it is and its use within React and used it as an example by fetching an API.

DAY 37

I looked at switch statements and how to incorporate them within a new hook, useReducer hook and the basic conceptual flow of how to use them as another hook within React tools.

DAY 38

I went over git commands that covered git branching in regards to multiple people working on one project. I also had an introduction to learning about React testing library, how it works ects so I have a basic understanding of what/why its used. 

DAY 39

Today I spent about an hour of my morning on codewars to help improve my computational thinking. Listened to a guest speaker about working in teams and finally continued working on react testing library.

DAY 40

Today, was another Hackathon, where I attempted in a group to make an app in react. We managed to create and achieve our mpv but did not manage to have the time to add in all the CSS features we would have liked. It was a quote generating app.

DAY 41

I looked over useState to refresh what I had learnt as I hadnt looked over it within the last week. I jumped on a zoom call with other bootcampers to revise this further.

DAY 42

Today I joined another study session with some of my fellow bootcampers and we looked over the topics, useEffect and useReducer hooks. I also carried on with the React testing workshop to help familiarise myself with testing.


DAY 43

Today I started working on a project, that is based on making an frontended app that resolves some of the issues bootcampers face. We were able to find a problem and think of a solution and visualise a mvp model.

DAY 44

Continued with our project week, where we were able to finish our wireframe template  of how we want our app to look like. Continued working on user personas and journeys. We also managed to create our main plan to refer to completing next goals. 

DAY 45

Another day working on our Project. Had to scope our MVP back as one functionality wasnt working and didnt want to spend more time on it as we had to move on to keep to the time limit.

DAY 46

Today we added a key feature using a new concept, React Router that enabled us to be able to switch pages. As a result, we were able to start added more CSS features. 

DAY 47

Today we completed our MVP, adding our final feature of a ranking system and setting local storage to save content whent the page renders.

Day 48

Today we spent time practising our presentation, after making a script and finally presented our app infront of a panel of judges from the industry.

DAY 49

Today I looked more into React Router as it was really useful to use in my project week app, thus wanted to research into it further to have a better understanding of how it works and what else it can do. 

DAY 50

Today,  worked on a bit of codewars as I have not done any all week long, thus wanted to get back into it. I also noticed I struggeled remembering conditionals, and thereefore went over some basics.

DAY 51

I spent this day working on more codewars as I struggled with a few the day before. I also went over more javascript basics using codeacademy.

DAY 52

Today was started off with codewars working on a couple of challenges. I also started on working on Javascript basics in regards to functions. I also did some research on some tech companies.

DAY 53

Today I worked on some more CSS looking at flexbox learning about justify-content, align-item and flex-direction as well as order. 

DAY 54

Today was hackathon Friday, were the breif was about

DAY 55

Today consisted spending some of morning completing some codewar challenges. I also looked at node.js in more detail, such what it is, how to stringyfy javascript and how to parse json.

DAY 56

today was looking at REST API's and CROUD routes. It was very difficult to grasp to begin with as there were many topics to cover as well as understand them conceptually in order to write the syntax and execute. More learning on this will be needed.
