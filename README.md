# 100-Days-Of-Code-
Set to take the #100daysofcode challenge, in which I'll commit to challenging myself to code everyday and share and document my progress of what of my journey over the next 100 days.

DAY 1
I'm starting this challenge on day 1 of the SoC bootcamp kick off. Today we covered the importance of computational thinking and how we should use and refer back to it throughout the duration of the bootcamp but also in everyday tech. The process consisted of 5 areas: understanding the problem, breaking it down into smaller problems, looking for patterns, applying real life models as well as algorithms. We also covered css diner in pairs to revise CSS. I had a lot of nerves before today's session, however I'm feeling less anxious having met other bootcampers and having a more of a feel of what the SoC is about. Excited for what's to come!

DAY 2:

Today I went over computational thinking again, learning more terminology to solidify everything I’ve learnt so far, and had exercises where we could practise this. For example, I made a scratch game but had to plan every step beforehand to produce it, so I would have an algorithm to refer to in future. 
We also went over github to refresh what we previously learned such as making changes to files, as well as pulling and pushing from the local to remote repository and vice versa.

 Day 3 I jumped into Javascript fundamentals such as types, variables and functions. We practised using the console trial and error to see what did and didn’t work. I also incorporated using github and the terminal and coned files to edit some Javascript code. I did find JS functions not very clear so I will continue to work on that after todays bootcamp session.
