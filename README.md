# 100-Days-Of-Code-
Set to take the #100daysofcode challenge, in which I'll commit to challenging myself to code everyday and share and document my progress of what of my journey over the next 100 days.

DAY 1
I'm starting this challenge on day 1 of the SoC bootcamp kick off. Today we covered the importance of computational thinking and how we should use and refer back to it throughout the duration of the bootcamp but also in everyday tech. The process consisted of 5 areas: understanding the problem, breaking it down into smaller problems, looking for patterns, applying real life models as well as algorithms. We also covered css diner in pairs to revise CSS. I had a lot of nerves before today's session, however I'm feeling less anxious having met other bootcampers and having a more of a feel of what the SoC is about. Excited for what's to come!
